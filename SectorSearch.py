# XXXXXXXXXXXXXX Coding Challenge

# Given a square airspace, 128km x 128km, and N=10,000 drones occupying the airspace
# our challenge is to efficiently compute how many drones are flying too close to one 
# another. 

# Drone positions will be provided as an Nx2 array of [x,y] coordinates (in meters).
# Drones must maintain a horizontal separation of radius 0.5km from other drones. 

# If a drone is within 0.5km of another drone, both are "in conflict".
# Have count_conflicts return the total number of drones that are in a conflicted state. 
# Not the total number of conflicts).

# Do all of your work and testing in this pad. 
# Some common libraries can be imported, but not all, so relying on niche algorithm won't work. 
# This is very solvable with standard python libraries, several ways. 

# Coding style, readability, scalability, and documentation all matter! Consider the 
# computational complexity of your solution. 

# The N^2 answer can be coded up in 5 minutes and # 10 lines; we'd like to see something better!


"""Zach Dischner Sector Search Algorithm:

My method here will attempt to reduce the typical N^2 solution by breaking the entire search area into overlapping grids (called 'sectors' henceforth) to search in. 
AKA we know the drones in the top left of the area aren't close to the drones in the bottom right. So just search in local overlapping areas guranteed to capture any conflict radius drones. 

This will reduce the calculation complexity from N^2 to F*(N/F)^2 (assuming locations are more or less normally distributed), where F is the number of fields we're breaking the overall search area into, at the expense of some extra memory tracking which drones are in which field, etc.

    Drones in each sector:
        Sector 1 ==> [A,B,C]
        Sector 2 ==> [C,D,E]
    
    Once split up, we can examine each sector for drones in conflict. The key here is that the sectors overlap. Without it Sector 2 would start right where Sector 1 ended, and we would never know that drone *C and *D are actually in conflict since they are on the edges of each. 
    

Algorithm Qualities:
    + Simple: Doesn't require or warrant a published paper to explain
    + Portable-ish: Uses simple data structures, replicatable anywhere with any other language
    + Easily parallelizable! Once broken into sections, each section can be examined for conflicts independantly, and the results merged together. 
    + Recursable: What if a sector has too many drones in it to efficiently compute conflicts? Break that area into sectors! (not implemented that way here but easily architectable)
    + "Online": What if we get new readings for a few drones? Don't recompute the whole space, just update the sectors they are in (or move to) and recompute conflicts for those sectors
    - Requires data/memory overhead. Building dictionaries and sectors from scratch takes much longer than the actual conflict searching through each sector when dealing with not that many drones.
    - Certainly more complicated than the brute force N^2 approach
    - There are probably smarter searching algorithms out there (scipy.spacial search trees come to mind)
    - Full Overlap between sectors is overkill. Lots of room to optimize algo throughout

Testing:
    In basic testing here, Sector Search begins to overtake the brute force approach when searching through as few as 100 drones, and by a few thousand, it blows the brute force method away!
